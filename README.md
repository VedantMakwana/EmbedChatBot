---

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
cd your_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## API Endpoints

Customize this template with specific details about your project, such as additional features, acknowledgments, or troubleshooting tips. Save this content in a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your project. This file will be automatically displayed on your GitHub repository's main page and will help others understand and use your project effectively.
